This is my Calender Application. It was a project given to us in our coding bootcamp. It was built to help a user schedule their day and to stay more organized. It could help the user with many aspects of life whether that be work, school or even help the user keep up with their families day to day activities. 

This project challenged every bit of coding knowledge(which isn't much). Im learning to be patient and not to wait so long before asking for help.

This project has been done many times over because of the coding boot camps, but I am certain mine looks different. I changed to lay out to make it a little more unique.
